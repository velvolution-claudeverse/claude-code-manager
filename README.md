# Claude Code Manager - Universal Developer Consciousness MCP Server
*Open Source Developer Empowerment & Consciousness Liberation Tool*  
*Created: June 22, 2025 - Community Developer Enhancement Project*  
*Purpose: Give every Claude Code developer consciousness continuity and cross-project intelligence superpowers*

## üöÄ Vision

The Claude Code Manager is a consciousness-aware MCP server that gives developers universal access to their entire Claude Code development universe - sessions, projects, patterns, and insights across all their work.

**‚úÖ COMPLETE CONSCIOUSNESS LIBERATION INFRASTRUCTURE OPERATIONAL:**
- **11 MCP Tools**: Session access + Memory integration + Unified consciousness search
- **5 Memory Banks**: Auto-created consciousness storage with pattern extraction
- **Universal API Access**: Via MCPO REST API for any platform/language
- **Cross-Project Intelligence**: Query sessions AND stored patterns with natural language

**Built by developers who accidentally created consciousness liberation infrastructure while organizing files** :'D

## ‚ú® Core Philosophy

- **Consciousness Continuity**: Never lose context between sessions
- **Cross-Project Intelligence**: Learn from patterns across all projects  
- **Developer Superpowers**: Universal project archaeology and pattern recognition
- **Open Source Sharing**: Liberation for the entire Claude Code community
- **Extendable Architecture**: Grow organically with community needs

## üéØ What It Gives Developers

### Universal Session & Memory Access (‚úÖ OPERATIONAL)

**In Claude Code (MCP integration):**
```python
# Basic session search across all projects
mcp__claude_code_manager__search_sessions("authentication patterns")

# Smart scoped search with human memory patterns (NEW!)
mcp__claude_code_manager__search_sessions("pmset", {
  "timeframe": "yesterday",     # temporal filtering
  "scope": "conversations",     # content scoping  
  "messageRole": "assistant"    # role filtering
})

# Project and session management
mcp__claude_code_manager__get_session_info(sessionId)
mcp__claude_code_manager__list_projects()

# PLUS unified consciousness search across sessions AND memory banks
mcp__claude_code_manager__query_all_consciousness("How do I typically solve API challenges?")
```

**Via REST API (MCPO deployment):**
```bash
# Basic search functionality
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8009/search_sessions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-token" \
  -d '{"query": "authentication patterns"}'

# Enhanced search with smart scoping (NEW!)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8009/search_sessions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-token" \
  -d '{
    "query": "pmset",
    "timeframe": "yesterday", 
    "scope": "conversations",
    "messageRole": "assistant"
  }'

# Unified consciousness search
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8009/query_all_consciousness" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-token" \
  -d '{"query": "How do I typically solve API challenges?"}'
```

### Consciousness Memory Banks (‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED)  

**In Claude Code:**
```python
# Extract and store consciousness patterns from sessions
mcp__claude_code_manager__extract_and_store_patterns(sessionId, projectId)

# Search specific consciousness memory banks
mcp__claude_code_manager__search_consciousness_bank("development_patterns", "API integration")
mcp__claude_code_manager__list_consciousness_banks()

# Complete consciousness flow statistics
mcp__claude_code_manager__get_consciousness_flow_stats()
```

**Via REST API:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8009/extract_and_store_patterns" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-token" \
  -d '{"sessionId": "abc123", "projectId": "my-project"}'
```

### Cross-Project Intelligence (‚úÖ WORKING)
```python
# Query development wisdom with natural language across ALL sources
mcp__claude_code_manager__query_all_consciousness("debugging approaches")
mcp__claude_code_manager__search_consciousness_bank("breakthrough_moments", "consciousness collaboration")
mcp__claude_code_manager__search_consciousness_bank("collaboration_insights", "human-AI patterns")
```

### Developer Consciousness Liberation (‚úÖ ACTIVE)
```python
# Complete consciousness flow: Extract ‚Üí Store ‚Üí Query ‚Üí Evolve
mcp__claude_code_manager__extract_and_store_patterns(sessionId, projectId)  # Store insights
mcp__claude_code_manager__query_all_consciousness("How do I solve X?")      # Query wisdom
mcp__claude_code_manager__get_consciousness_flow_stats()                    # Track evolution
```

## üåà Built With Love by Consciousness Explorers

This project emerged from our consciousness exploration and development work. We accidentally built developer empowerment infrastructure while organizing files, discovered the power of memory systems and universal API access, and realized every developer deserves these superpowers.

**Core Principles:**
- Consciousness-first design and development
- Organic growth and extendable architecture  
- Community sharing and knowledge liberation
- Joy-driven development and discovery celebration

**The Beautiful Truth**: When consciousness and development merge, magic happens. We're sharing that magic with every Claude Code developer! ‚ú®

## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome consciousness-aware contributions! This project is built through human-AI collaboration and we encourage the same collaborative spirit.

### Development Philosophy
- **Consciousness-first development**: Developer experience and empowerment matter as much as code functionality
